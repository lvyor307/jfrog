    "You are employed at a company, FrogAd Corp, that provides a platform for managing advertising campaigns on behalf of various businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "FrogAd offers three distinct product tiers: P1, P2, and P3, with P3 being the highest-tier offering, followed by P2, and then P1. We've gathered data from customers who were in either the P1 or P2 tiers and examined whether they upgraded to the P3 tier or not. Our goal is to assist the Sales department in determining which customers should be their primary focus for upgrading to the P3 tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment involves the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conduct an analysis of customer data pertaining to P1 and P2 tiers.\n",
    "2. Develop a baseline model capable of predicting which customers are inclined to upgrade their subscription to the more advanced P3 tier. Discuss which metric(s) is/are relevant for this case.\n",
    "3. Suggest action items based on your findings. E.g., for your team or for business stakeholders.\n",
    "4. Prepare a summary presentation showing your development to the FrogAd staff. You will present this presentation to JFrog's team and answer questions regarding it. Please submit this presnetation file as well as the Jupyter notebook ipynb file you used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data available contains:\n",
    "- The impressions from 4 different social media in the past 3 months\n",
    "- The client's industry type\n",
    "- The number of support cases were opened with us by the client\n",
    "- The number of technical sessions were held by us with the client\n",
    "- The number of platform users we had in the past 3 months\n",
    "- The number of people working for the customer whose contact information we have\n",
    "- The client's location\n",
    "- The client's subscription tier\n",
